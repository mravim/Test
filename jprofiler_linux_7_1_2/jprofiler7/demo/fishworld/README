===================

FishWorld is a simple and amusing point and click Java applet game.


Fishes come from both sides of the screen. The goal of the game is to let no
fish through to the other side. You get points for every fish you kill (left
click). The more points you get, the faster the game will be. So it becomes
more difficult the longer you play. You have three sticks of dynamite you can
use to kill all fishes currently on the screen (right click). Use it wisely.
When you achieve a highscore, the score is saved but only as long as the applet
is loaded.

You can download the latest version of FishWorld from the following website:

FishWorld is written as a Java applet. To run it just load the file

No animals were harmed during the creation of this game. I do not advocate
killing real life fishes. Far from it: I urge you to let animals live. Please
