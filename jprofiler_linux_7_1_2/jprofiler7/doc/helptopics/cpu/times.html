<h3>1. Wall clock time and CPU time</h3>
    
      When the duration of a method call is measured, there are two different possibilities to measure
      it:
      <ul>
<li>
          
<p>
            Most likely you'll be interested in the <b>wall clock time</b>, that is the duration between
            the entry and the exit of a method as measured with a clock. For the profiling agent this is
            a straightforward measurement. While it might seem at first glance that measuring times should
            not have any significant overhead, this is not so if you need a high resolution measurement.
            Operating systems offer different timers with different performance overheads.
          </p>
          
<p>
            For example, on Microsoft Windows, the standard timer with a granularity of 10 milliseconds
            is very fast, because the operating system "caches" the current time. However, the duration of method
            calls can be as low as a few nanoseconds, so a high resolution timer is needed. A high resolution
            timer works directly with a special hardware device and carries a noticeable performance overhead.
            In JProfiler, CPU recording is disabled by default, however, method call recording is always enabled.
            If you compare the duration of the startup sequence of an application server with and without
            CPU recording, you will notice the difference.
          </p>
          
<p>
            Wall clock time is measured separately for each thread. In CPU views where the thread selection
            includes multiple threads, the displayed times can be larger than the total execution time of
            the application. If you have 10 parallel threads of the same class <code>MyThreadClass</code>
            whose <code>run()</code> method take 1 second and "All threads" is selected in the call tree,
            the <code>MyThreadClass.run()</code> node in the call tree will display 10 seconds, even though
            only one second has passed.
          </p>
        
</li>
<li>
          
<p>
            Since the CPU might be handling many threads with different priorities, the wall clock time is
            not the time the CPU has actually spent in that method. The scheduler of the operating system
            can interrupt the execution of a method multiple times and perform other tasks. The real time
            that was spent in the method by the CPU is called the <b>CPU time</b>.
            In extreme cases, the CPU time and the wall clock time can differ by a large factor, especially
            if the executing thread has a low priority.
          </p>
          
<p>
            The standard time measurement in JProfiler is wall clock time. If you wish to see the CPU
            time in the CPU views, you can change the measurement type in the profiling settings.
            The problem with CPU time measurement is that most operating systems provide this
            information with the granularity of the standard timer - high resolution measurements
            would carry to much overhead. This means the CPU times are only statistically valid
            for method that have a CPU time bigger that the typical granularity of 10 milliseconds.
          </p>
        
</li>
</ul>
    
<br>
    
<h3>2. Thread statuses</h3>
    
<p>
      The notion of time measurement must be refined further, since not all times are equally interesting.
      Imagine a server application with a pool of threads that waiting to perform a task.
      Most of the time would then be in the method that keeps the threads waiting while the actual
      task will only get a small part of the overall time and will be hard to spot.
      The necessary refinement is done with the concept of <b>thread status</b>.
      There are 4 different thread statuses in JProfiler:
      <ul>
<li>
<span class="sectiontitle">Runnable</span>
<br>
          In this case the thread is ready to execute code. The reason that this is not called "Running" is
          that it may actually not be running due to the scheduler of the operating system. However,
          if given a chance, the thread will execute instructions.
        </li>
<li>
<span class="sectiontitle">Waiting</span>
<br>
          This means that the thread has deliberately decided to enter into hibernation until a certain
          event occurs. This happens when you call <code>Object.wait()</code> and the current thread
          will only become runnable again when some other thread calls <code>Object.notify()</code>
          on the same object.
        </li>
<li>
<span class="sectiontitle">Blocking</span>
<br>
          Whenever synchronized blocks of code or synchronized methods occur, there can be monitor
          contention. If one thread is in the synchronized area all other threads trying to enter it
          will be blocked. Frequent blocking can reduce the liveness of your application.
        </li>
<li>
<span class="sectiontitle">Net I/O</span>
<br>
          During network operations, many calls in the Java standard libraries can block because
          they're waiting for more data. This kind of blocking is called "Net I/O" in JProfiler.
          JProfiler knows the list of methods in the JRE that lead to blocked net I/O and instruments
          them at load time.
        </li>
</ul>
    
</p>
    
<p>
      When looking for performance bottlenecks, you're mostly interested in the "Runnable" thread state
      although it's always a good idea to have a look at the "Net I/O" and "Blocking" thread states in
      order to check if the network or synchronization issues are reducing the performance of your
      application.
    </p>
    
<h3>3. Times in the call tree</h3>
    
<p>
      Nodes in the call tree (methods, classes, packages or Java EE components, depending on the selected
      aggregation level) are sorted by <b>total time</b>. This is the sum
      of all execution times of this node on the particular call path as given by the ancestor nodes.
      Only threads in the current thread selection are considered and only measurements with the currently
      selected thread status are shown.
    </p>
    
<p>
      Optionally, the call tree offers the possibility to show the <b>inherent time</b> of a
      node. The inherent time is defined as the total time of of a method minus the time of its child
      nodes. Since child nodes can only be in unfiltered classes, calls into filtered classes go into the
      inherent time. If you change your
      <a href="../../../doc/helptopics/config/callTreeCollection.html">method call recording filters</a>,
      the inherent times in the call tree can change.
    </p>
    
<h3>4. Times in the hotspots view</h3>
    
<p>
      While the call tree view shows all call stacks in your application, the hotspot view shows
      the methods that take most of the time. Each method can potentially be called through many
      different call stacks, so the invocation counts in the call tree and the hotspots view do not
      have to match. The hotspot view shows the inherent time rather than the total time. In addition,
      the hotspot view offers the option to include calls to filtered classes into the inherent time.
      Please see the article on
      <a href="../../../doc/helptopics/cpu/hotspotsAndFilters.html">hotspots and filters</a> for a
      thorough discussion of this topic.
    </p>
    
<p>
      When you open a hotspot node, you see a reverse call tree. However, the times that
      are displayed in those <b>backtraces</b> do not have the same meaning as those in the
      call tree, since they do not express a time measurement for the corresponding node.
      Rather, the time displayed at each node indicates how much time that particular
      call tree contributes to the hot spot. If there is only one backtrace, you will see the hotspot
      time at each node.
    </p>
    
<h3>5. Times in the call graph</h3>
    
<p>
      The times that are shown for <b>nodes</b> (methods, classes, packages or Java EE components, depending on the selected
      aggregation level) in the call graph are the same as those in the hotspots view. The times that are associated
      with the <b>incoming arrows</b> are the same as those in the first level of the hot spot backtrace,
      since they show all calling nodes and the cumulated duration of their calls. The time on the
      <b>outgoing arrows</b> is a measurement that cannot be found in the call tree.
      It shows the cumulated duration of calls from this node, while the call tree
      shows the cumulated duration of calls from the current call stack.
