<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
    
      Although it is easiest to profile applications and application servers that are running on
      your local machine, sometimes it is not possible to replicate the execution environment
      on your computer. If you have no physical access to the remote machine or if the remote machine has
      no GUI where you could run JProfiler, you have to set up remote profiling.
    <br>
    
<p>
      Remote profiling means that the profiling agent is running on the remote machine and the JProfiler
      GUI is running on your local machine. Profiling agent and JProfiler GUI communicate with each other
      through a socket. This situation is fundamentally the same as running a session that is launcher on the
      local machine, just that the socket communication socket connects between different machines.
      The main difference for you is that for launched sessions you don't have to worry about the location of native libraries
      and that the startup sequence can be managed by JProfiler.
    </p>

    
<h3>2. The jpenable command line utility</h3>
    
<p>
      To avoid running an integration wizard or modifying the VM parameters of the profiled application,
      just extract the JProfiler archive from the
      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ej-technologies.com/download/jprofiler/files.html">download page</a>
      on the remote machine. You do not have to enter a license key there. Run the
      <b><tt>bin/jpenable</tt></b> command line application on the remote machine. You will be able to
      select a JVM and load the profiling agent into it so that is listens on a specific profiling port.
      In your local JProfiler GUI, you can then connect with an "Attach to profiled JVM (local or remote)" session.
    </p>
    
<p>
      This only works with a Java VM of version 1.6 or higher and has the drawback that array allocations are
      not recorded, i.e. stack trace information for array allocations is not available. Also, if you're
      profiling regularly, it might be more convenient to prepare a permanent setup that does not require you to
      run the <b><tt>jpenable</tt></b> executable every time.
    </p>

    
<h3>3. The remote integration wizard</h3>
    
<p>
      All integration wizards in JProfiler can help you with setting up remote profiling.
      After choosing the integration type or application server, the wizard asks you where
      the profiled application is located. If you choose the remote option, there will be
      additional questions regarding the remote machine.
    </p>
    
<p>
      
<img style="vertical-align: middle" align="middle" border="0" src="../../../doc/images/integration_wizard.png">
    </p>
    
<p>
      When the remote integration wizard asks you for startup scripts or other files of
      the application server on the remote machine it brings up a standard file selector.
      If the file system of the remote machine is accessible as a network drive or mounted
      into your file system, you can select those files and JProfiler will directly write
      modified files to the right location.
    </p>
    
<p>
      If you do not have direct access to the file system of the remote machine, you have two options:
      You can use the console integration wizard by executing <i><tt>bin/jpintegrate</tt></i> on the remote machine.
      Alternatively, you can copy the required files to the local machine and use the "remote" option in the integration wizard.
      However, you must then transfer the modified or new files back to the remote machine after the integration wizard has completed.
    </p>

    
<h3>4. Requirements for remote profiling</h3>
    
<p>
      Although the integration wizards in JProfiler give you all required information,
      it's always a good idea to have a little more inside knowledge about the
      mechanics and the requirements of remote profiling. When
      trouble-shooting a failed integration, you should check that the requirements
      below are fulfilled correctly.
    </p>
    
<p>
      The following requirements have to be satisfied for remote profiling:
      <ol style="list-style-image: none">
<li>
          
<p>
            JProfiler has to be installed on the local machine <b>and</b> on the remote machine.
            If the remote machine is a Unix machine, you might not be able to run the GUI installer
            of JProfiler. In this case, please use the <b><tt>.tar.gz</tt></b> archive to install
            JProfiler.
          </p>
          
<p>
            Unless you specified the "nowait" parameter on the command line together with a "config" argument,
            (only necessary for pre 1.6 JVMs), you do <b>not</b> have to enter a license key on the
            remote machine, the license key is always provided by the JProfiler GUI. Because of that, it is
            sufficient to unpack JProfiler to any directory where you have write permission.
          </p>
        
</li>
<li>
          The operating system and the architecture of the remote machine must be explicitly
          supported by JProfiler. Please see the
          <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/featuresPlatforms.html">list of supported platforms</a>
          for more information. JProfiler is not a pure Java application, it contains a lot of native code
          which is not easily portable to unsupported platforms.
        </li>
<li>
          
<p>
            On the remote machine, you have to add a number of VM parameters to the java invocation
            of your application server or your standalone application. The fundamental VM parameters
             are <code>-Xrunjprofiler</code> for Java &lt;=1.4.2 (JVMPI) and
            <code>-agentpath:[path to jprofilerti library]</code>
             for Java &gt;=1.5.0 (JVMTI), which tell the JVM to load the native profiling agent.
            The help page on <a href="../../../doc/sessions/remote.html">remote sessions</a>
            in the reference section tells you the corresponding path to the jprofilerti library for all platforms.
          </p>
          
<p>
            Depending on your JVM and your platform, you have to add further VM parameters to your
            java invocation.
            The <a href="../../../doc/sessions/remoteTable.html">remote session invocation table</a>
            in the reference section gives you the exact parameter sequence for your configuration.
          </p>
          
<p>
            This is all that is required to profile a modern JVM (Java 1.5 and later).
          </p>
        
</li>
<li>
          For Java &lt;=1.4.2 (JVMPI), more steps are necessary. You also have to add
          <code>-Xbootclasspath/a:{path to agent.jar}</code> which adds required Java classes
          to the bootclasspath. <b><tt>agent.jar</tt></b> is located in the <i><tt>bin</tt></i>
          directory of your JProfiler installation. In addition, the native library path on the
          remote machine must contain the platform-specific directory in
          the <i><tt>bin</tt></i> directory of the JProfiler installation. The "native library path" is
          defined by a different environment variable on each platform. For example, on Windows, it
          is simply the <code>PATH</code> environment variable, on Linux it is <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>.
          The help page on <a href="../../../doc/sessions/remote.html">remote sessions</a>
          in the reference section tells you the corresponding environment variables for all platforms.
         </li>
<li>
          On the local machine, you have to define a "Attach to profiled JVM" session whose "host" entry points
          to the remote machine.
        </li>
</ol>
    
</p>
    
<h3>5. Starting remote profiling</h3>
    
<p>
      If you run the integration wizard for a local application server, JProfiler will be able
      to start it and connect to it. JProfiler has no way to start the application server if it
      is located on a remote machine. For remote applications and application servers, you have
      to perform <b>two</b> actions to start the profiling session:
    </p>
    
<ol style="list-style-image: none">
<li>
        Execute the modified start script on the remote machine. Depending on what option you have chosen in the
        remote profiling wizard, there are two startup sequences: either the application or application
        server starts up completely, or it prints a few lines of information and tells you that it is waiting for a connection.
        With Java 1.6.0 and later, the profiling options will be sent to the profiling agent when the GUI connects and you don't have
        to copy your config file to the server.
        <p>
          With Java 1.5.0 and earlier, changing profiling settings at runtime is not possible. In the case
          where the application does not wait for a connection from the JProfiler GUI,
          the profiling agent loads the profiling configuration from the <tt>config.xml</tt> file you
          have copied to the server as instructed by the integration wizard.
        </p>
      
</li>
<li>
        Start the "Attach to profiled JVM" session in the JProfiler GUI on the local machine. The session
        will connect to the remote computer and the remote application or application server
        will then start up if it waited for the GUI connection.
      </li>
</ol>
    
<h3>6. Trouble-shooting</h3>
    
<p>
      When things don't work out as expected, please have a look at the terminal output of the
      profiled application or application server on the remote machine. For application servers, the
      stderr stream might be written to a log file. Depending on the content of the stderr output,
      the search for the problem takes different directions:
    </p>
    
<ul>
<li>
        If stderr contains <tt>"Waiting for connection ..."</tt>, the configuration of the remote
        machine is ok. The problem might then be related to the following questions:
        <ul>
<li>Did you forget to start the "Attach to profiled JVM" session in the JProfiler GUI on your local machine?</li>
<li>Is the host name or the IP address correctly configured in the "Attach to profiled JVM" session?</li>
<li>Is there a firewall between the local machine or the remote machine?</li>
</ul>
      
</li>
<li>
        If stderr contains an error message about not being able to bind a socket, the port is already
        in use. The problem might then be related to the following questions:
        <ul>
<li>
            Did you start JProfiler multiple times on the remote machine? Each profiled
            application needs a separate communication port.
            Please see below on how to change that port.
          </li>
<li>
            Are there any zombie java processes of previous profiling runs that are
            blocking the port? In this case please kill these processes.
          </li>
<li>
            Is there a different application on the remote machine that is
            using the JProfiler port? Please see below on how to change the port
            for JProfiler.
          </li>
</ul>
        
<p>
          The communication port is defined as a parameter to the profiling agent VM parameter.
          To define a communication port of 25000, please change this VM parameter
          to <code>-Xrunjprofiler:port=25000</code> for Java &lt;=1.4.2 (JVMPI) or
          <code>-agentpath:[path to jprofilerti library]=port=25000</code> for Java &gt;=1.5.0 (JVMTI).
          Also, please make sure that the same port is configured in the "Attach to profiled JVM" session in the
          JProfiler GUI on your local machine. Please note that this port has nothing to do with
          HTTP or other standard port numbers and must not be the same as any port that's already
          in use on the remote machine.
        </p>
      
</li>
<li>
        
<p>
          For Java 1.4.2 and earlier,
          if stderr contains an error message about not being able to load native libraries,
          the native library path is not configured correctly. Please see the requirements
          above on how to configure the native library directory. If the problem persist,
          it might be a problem with dependencies. On Unix platforms, you can execute
          <pre>
      LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ldd libjprofiler.so
          </pre>
          in the native library directory to get information about missing dependencies. On
          Microsoft Windows, you can download the dependency walker from
          <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dependencywalker.com">http://www.dependencywalker.com</a>
          to analyze the problem.
        </p>
        
<p>
          Please note that it is <b>not</b> a good
          idea to define the VM parameter <code>java.library.path</code>. If you absolutely have to do that,
          please make sure that the definition contains the appropriate native library directory
          for JProfiler.
        </p>
      
</li>
<li>
        
<p>
          For Java 1.4.2 and earlier,
          if stderr contains a <code>NoClassDefFoundError</code> for a class in the
          <code>com.jprofiler.agent</code> package, the bootclasspath has not been
          configured correctly. Please see the requirements above on how to configure 
          the bootclasspath. Putting <b><tt>agent.jar</tt></b> in the regular
          classpath does <b>not</b> help and may actually be harmful.
        </p>
        
<p>
          
<code>NoClassDefFoundError</code>s also occur if there is a classloader problem.
          The most common case is if the profiled application is an
          <a target="_blank" href="http://www.osgi.org">OSGi</a> application. In some OSGi applications, you have to
          add the JProfiler agent package <tt>com.jprofiler.agent</tt> to the standard
          variable <tt>org.osgi.framework.bootdelegation</tt> in the OSGi configuration file. For
          <a target="_blank" href="http://www.eclipse.org/equinox">eclipse Equinox</a>, this is the
          <i><tt>config.ini</tt></i> file, for  <a target="_blank" href="http://felix.apache.org">Apache Felix</a>,
          this is the <i><tt>config.properties</tt></i> file.
        </p>
      
</li>
<li>
        
<p>
          If there are no lines in stderr that are prefixed with
          <tt>JProfiler&gt;</tt> and your application or application server starts up normally,
          the <code>-Xrunjprofiler</code> for Java &lt;=1.4.2 (JVMPI) or <code>-agentpath:[path to jprofilerti library]</code>
          for Java &gt;=1.5.0 (JVMTI) VM parameter have not been included in the
          java call. Please find out which java call in your startup script is actually executed
          and add the VM parameters there.
        </p>
      
</li>
</ul>
