      The probes view has a <b>probe selector</b> drop-down list at the top which shows all built-in probes
      as well as all custom probes that were detected in the profiled JVM. Custom probes can be defined in the
      <a href="../../../doc/sessions/probes/custom.html">session settings</a> or registered on the command line with a
      reference to a <code>com.jprofiler.api.agent.probe.ProbeProvider</code>.
      <p>
        Unless the probe has been configured to record data at startup, you have to start recording data manually
        with the probe recording button next to the probe selector. Recording is switched on and off separately for
        each probe. By default, only the JEE built-in probes and custom probes are configured to start recording at startup.
        To change this behavior, select the corresponding option for
        <a href="../../../doc/sessions/probes/builtin.html">built-in probes</a> or call
        <code>metaData.recordOnStartup(false)</code> in the meta-data script of
