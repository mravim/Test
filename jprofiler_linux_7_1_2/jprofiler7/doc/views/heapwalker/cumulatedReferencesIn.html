      The cumulated incoming references show the list of all reference types through which
      the instances of classes and arrays in the current object set are held.
      This view has two display modes that determine how the "Object count" and the "Size" column
      have to be interpreted:
      <ul>
<li>
<span class="sectiontitle">Show counts and sizes of reference holders</span>
<br>
          The "Object count" and the "Size" columns refer to the objects that
          reference any objects in the current object set through a certain reference type.
        </li>
<li>
<span class="sectiontitle">Show counts and sizes of referenced objects</span>
<br>
          The "Object count" and the "Size" columns refer to the objects in the current object set
          that are referenced through a certain reference type.
        </li>
</ul>
      
<p>
        There are three columns shown in the table, which can be <a href="../../../doc/views/common/sorting.html">sorted</a>:
      </p>
      
<ul>
<li>
<span class="sectiontitle">Reference type</span>
<br>
          Shows the type of the incoming reference which is one of
          <ul>
<li>
<span class="sectiontitle">field</span>
<br>
              some of the objects or arrays in the current object set are held in the
              indicated field of an instance of the indicated class.
            </li>
<li>
<span class="sectiontitle">static field</span>
<br>
              some of the objects or arrays in the current object set are held in the
              indicated static field of the indicated class.
            </li>
<li>
<span class="sectiontitle">constant</span>
<br>
              some of the objects or arrays in the current object set are held in the
              constant pool of the indicated class. These references mostly stem from
              constants declared as <tt>private static final</tt>.
            </li>
<li>
<span class="sectiontitle">object array content</span>
<br>
              some of the objects in the current object set are held in an array of
              instances of classes. The arrays are of types or supertypes of the held
              objects. A further distinction is not possible due to the nature of
              Java bytecode.
            </li>
<li>
<span class="sectiontitle">JNI global/local reference</span>
<br>
              some of the objects or arrays in the current object set are held through
              the Java Native Interface. Generally global references are persistent
              across a number of native calls which local references are only valid for
              the duration of one native call. These references are of interest to
              JNI programmers only. If you do not use any extra native libraries and
              encounter these reference types nonetheless, they can be attributed to the
              internal state of the JVM. In that case, there won't be any accessible
              objects behind these references and the <tt>Size</tt> column will
              show a zero value.
            </li>
<li>
<span class="sectiontitle">java stack</span>
<br>
              some of the objects in the current object set are held in a stack frame of a
              thread.
            </li>
<li>
<span class="sectiontitle">sticky class, thread block, unknown type</span>
<br>
              internal references in the JVM.
            </li>
</ul>
          
<p>
            Note that for static fields, constants, java stack references and the internal
            references in the JVM the origin of the reference do not belong to accessible
            objects. The <tt>Size</tt> column shows a zero value and a filter
            selection is not possible for these incoming reference types.
          </p>
        
</li>
<li>
<span class="sectiontitle">Object count</span>
<br>
          Depending on the display mode, shows
          <ul>
<li>
<span class="sectiontitle">Show counts and sizes of reference holders</span>
<br>
              How many objects are holding on to any object in the current object set
              through this reference type.
            </li>
<li>
<span class="sectiontitle">Show counts and sizes of referenced objects</span>
<br>
              How many objects in the current object set are referenced
              through this reference type.
            </li>
</ul>
          The reference count is displayed graphically as well.
        </li>
<li>
<span class="sectiontitle">Size</span>
<br>
          Depending on the display mode, shows
          <ul>
<li>
<span class="sectiontitle">Show counts and sizes of reference holders</span>
<br>
              The total size of all objects that are holding on to any object in the
              current object set through this reference type.
            </li>
<li>
<span class="sectiontitle">Show counts and sizes of referenced objects</span>
<br>
              The total size of all objects in the current object set that are referenced
              through this reference type.
            </li>
</ul>
          
<p>
            Note that this is the
            <b>shallow size</b> which does not include the size of referenced arrays and
            instances but only the size of the corresponding pointers.

        The cumulated reference view is a <b>tree table</b>, you can open single references and view
        cumulated reference chains. Multiple selection is only possible on the same level in the tree.
      
      <p>
        The lengths of the bars in the object count column are adjusted for the sibling nodes in the tree (not the top level)
        and the colors of the bars alternate between dark and light red for descending tree levels.

      To add a selection step from this view you can
      <ul>
<li>
          select one or multiple references from the table and click the
          <b>[Use ...]</b> button above the table and choose
          <i>reference holders</i> in the popup menu.
          A new object set will be created that contains all objects that
          hold any object in the current object set by way of the selected reference types.
        </li>
<li>
          select one or multiple references from the table and click the
          <b>[Use ...]</b> button above the table and choose
          <i>referenced objects</i> in the popup menu.
          A new object set will be created that contains all objects in the current set
          that are held by a reference of one of the the selected types.
        </li>
<li>
          double click on a reference. Depending on the display mode, either the reference
          holders or the referenced objects are selected as the new object set.
        </li>
</ul>
      
<p>
        All reference types in your selection that do not lead to selectable objects are removed
        for the selection step. If no selectable objects are contained in your selection, the
        corresponding action will be disabled. 
      </p>
      
<p>
        A new object set will be created that contains all instances of classes and arrays
        that reference objects in the current object set via the selected references. After your selection,
        the <a href="../../../doc/views/heapwalker/viewChangeDialog.html">view helper dialog</a> will
        assist you in choosing the appropriate view for the new object set.
